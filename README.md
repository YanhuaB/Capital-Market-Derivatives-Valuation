# Capital Maket Derivatives Valuation

## Project Overview:
Developed and implemented a comprehensive financial model aimed at the valuation of various fixed income derivatives within capital markets. 
The project focused on creating a robust system capable of efficiently valuing complex derivatives while integrating market data such as bond prices, 
interest rate futures, and interest rate swaps. The model leverages automated processes for yield curve construction and derivative pricing, ensuring 
both accuracy and real-time adaptability. Key methodologies, including bootstrapping, were employed to construct a detailed yield curve that serves as 
the foundation for the derivative valuation process.

## Components:
**yield_curve.py:** Developed an automated financial model to calculate the valuation of fixed interest rate derivatives, incorporating
key inputs, outputs, assumptions, and limitations to ensure accuracy.

**Bootstrapping.py:** Created a model utilizing bootstrapping methodology to automatically generate a yield curve from observed bond, interest rate futures, and interest rate swap transaction data.
